					<div class="acc-body">
						We will arrange for you 3 days of excitement, fun and everything else you’d need to convert your idea into an application / prototype. You can build a web/mobile app based on a concept / idea you have on the given theme. 
						Even if you can't think of an idea right away, that's fine. Our team will reach out to you with a list of problem statements that you can optionally use, to build an idea on. 
						After all, it’s not the idea that matters but what you do with it.

					<div class="acc-body">
						 As artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, IoT and other disruptive technologies are going to take over our future, we believe that bringing in an element of <b>‘Smartness’</b> through technology to our lives, makes a lot of sense. 
						This smart world is set to be the next important stage in human history. 
						<b>MITS HACKATHON</b> aims at investigating on the essential problems and crucial issues in truly building the smart world that benefits humanity, and simultaneously safeguards the natural environment for sustainable development and evolution.

					</div>
					<div class="acc-body">
						 In each of the broad realms of human concern — sustainability, health, vulnerability, education, transportation, energy, infrastructure, joy of living — specific grand challenges await engineering solutions. 
						The bright minds competing in MITS hackathon will seek ways to put knowledge into practice to meet these grand challenges. 
						Applying the rules of reason, the findings of science, the aesthetics of art, and the spark of creative imagination, we expect them to bring in innovative and creative engineering solutions bringing in an element of <b>‘SMARTNESS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY’</b>.

					</div>
					<div class="acc-body">
					You might think your project isn’t impressive or it might not be finished so you don’t want to present it. You should present it anyway! Honestly, hackathons aren’t about being the best or being competitive. It’s all about having fun, making friends and learning how to become better at things you care about. Presenting your hack gives you a chance to be proud of what you’ve done, and you should be proud.

					</div>
					<div class="acc-body">
					You need that to be presenting a working prototype of what you developed. 
						The evaluation panel will consist of representatives from industry, academia and research. 
						We expect a comprehensive evaluation of the important 21st century engineering skills. 
						We also will be doing a quantitative mapping to the 12 Graduate attributes/ POs, consistent with the theme we follow here in MITS- ‘Engineer as a PO’. 
						The evaluation sheets with specific value points for evaluating 21st century engineering skills,Coding Skills,PO mappings will be used.
