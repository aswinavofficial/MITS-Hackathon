					<div class="acc-body">
						The grand challenges of the world  will be made available to the registered mail IDs at least 2 days before the competition. Each team can select one or more challenges and start ideation.
						On 16th Friday afternoon they will be presenting their ideas and proposed solutions to an expert panel containing stalwarts from industry and academia. 
						Once they get the green signal from the panel they can start working on the solution through software/hardware implementations.

						<i class="icon-acc"></i>
					</div>
					<div class="acc-body">
						MITS Hackathon is not a coding challenge. Rather it is a contest to identify and reward ‘The Real Engineer’. 
						We prefer a well ideated and designed hardware/software solution for some of the grand challenges in the world. 
						Rather than a plug and play solution we prefer solutions obtained after some rigorous programming.

					<div class="acc-body">
					You might think your project isn’t impressive or it might not be finished so you don’t want to present it. You should present it anyway! Honestly, hackathons aren’t about being the best or being competitive. It’s all about having fun, making friends and learning how to become better at things you care about. Presenting your hack gives you a chance to be proud of what you’ve done, and you should be proud.

						What’s the associated employability conclave?





						<i class="icon-acc"></i>
					</div>
					<div class="acc-body">
					 At this time when our need for engineering talent is huge, our country is clearly lagging behind in producing quality engineers with necessary employability skills. This can be attributed mostly to the huge gap existing between industry and academia. A simple curricular solution cannot address adequately this profound challenge. Rather, the stake holders from academia, industry and research need to form discursive alliances, based on mutual respect, that will enrich understanding and create the basis for meaningful deliberations. On that  note, Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science is organizing an ‘Employability Conclave’ on 16/03/2018, at Hotel Avenue Central, wherein some of the best minds from industry and academia is coming together under the same roof for sharing some interesting insights on "From Qualification based to Skill Based" - The Half- Life of Knowledge and changing employability scenario”.
                      <br/>
The registration and idea presentation for hackathon will happen after the conclave.
